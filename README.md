### solids4foam ###
solids4foam - a finite volume toolbox for solid mechanics and fluid solid
interaction simulations

### What is this repository for? ###

solids4foam is toolbox for OpenFOAM with capabilities for solid mechanics and
fluid solid interactions.

### How do I get set up? ###

To get setup, you must first have foam-extend-4.0 installed, details of which
can be found on the OpenFOAM Wiki at:
https://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Installation
Once foam-extend-4.0 has been installed, download solids4Foam and change to
the foam-extend-4.0 branch using the command:
$> git checkout foam-extend-4.0
then run the enclosed Allwmake script to compile soldis4Foam.
Note: the master branch is for foam-extend-3.2 but is not up-to-date.
Note2: the of30parFSIwip branch compiles with OpenFOAM-3.0.1 and includes
some of the functionality.

### Contribution guidelines ###
